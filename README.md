# ReviewSentiment_FHE

A confidential and privacy-preserving employee performance review platform powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and encrypted sentiment analysis.  
Managers can submit encrypted performance comments, and the system performs sentiment evaluation directly on encrypted text‚Äîproviding HR departments with aggregated insights on management tone, communication style, and team well-being, all without exposing individual reviews.

## Overview

In modern workplaces, performance reviews are essential for professional growth and organizational development.  
Yet traditional review systems often suffer from serious privacy and trust concerns:

- Managers may hesitate to write honest feedback, fearing misinterpretation or misuse.  
- Employees may feel uncomfortable knowing their reviews can be read by multiple intermediaries.  
- HR departments often rely on subjective interpretations rather than data-driven sentiment insights.  

**ReviewSentiment_FHE** solves these challenges through **homomorphic encryption** and secure natural language processing (NLP).  
With FHE, sentiment analysis occurs on encrypted data, so no one‚Äîincluding administrators or HR personnel‚Äîcan access the raw review text.  
The result is a system that quantifies sentiment and tone *without sacrificing confidentiality.*

## Why FHE Matters

Traditional encryption secures data during storage and transmission but requires decryption for processing.  
That creates a window of vulnerability‚Äîsomeone with access could read sensitive reviews.  

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** eliminates this risk. It enables computations, such as text sentiment scoring or polarity aggregation, **while the data remains encrypted**.  

Through this mechanism:

- Review texts stay private from submission to analysis.  
- Sentiment calculations are performed without ever revealing the actual content.  
- HR teams receive only encrypted or aggregated results‚Äînever plaintext data.  
- Organizations gain meaningful analytics while preserving the confidentiality of contributors.

This approach transforms performance management into a **privacy-first analytical process** rather than a subjective, exposed evaluation.

## Key Features

### üîê Encrypted Review Submission
- Managers submit comments encrypted with FHE public keys.  
- Reviews include encrypted text, employee identifier tags, and timestamp.  
- No plaintext review data is stored on-chain or in the database.

### üí¨ FHE-Based Sentiment Analysis
- Sentiment models evaluate tone (positive, neutral, negative) directly on ciphertexts.  
- Homomorphic evaluation returns encrypted sentiment scores.  
- Aggregation across teams or departments enables HR trend detection.

### üìä Aggregated Insights
- HR dashboards display aggregated positivity ratios, tone balance, and communication metrics.  
- FHE aggregation ensures no single review can be isolated or decrypted.  
- Helps organizations identify cultural strengths or communication gaps.

### üß† Anonymous Management Analytics
- Sentiment trends reveal leadership communication styles without exposing identities.  
- Statistical outputs enable HR to promote constructive management practices.  
- Insight is provided through privacy-preserving aggregation only.

## System Architecture

### 1. Encryption & Client Layer
- Encryption happens entirely in the client interface using FHE libraries.  
- Reviewers never send plaintext comments to the server.  
- Review submissions are batched, encrypted, and transmitted securely.

### 2. FHE Computation Engine
- Receives ciphertexts representing review embeddings.  
- Performs encrypted matrix operations simulating neural network sentiment scoring.  
- Aggregates encrypted outputs into department-level or company-level metrics.

### 3. Aggregation & Result Layer
- Produces encrypted numerical sentiment summaries.  
- HR can request decryption of aggregate values only‚Äînever individual reviews.  
- Optional threshold decryption ensures results are revealed only when privacy-safe.

### 4. Dashboard Interface
- Interactive visualization of encrypted analytics.  
- Displays department positivity indices and temporal sentiment trends.  
- Provides actionable insight without violating data confidentiality.

## Security Principles

| Layer | Mechanism | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Data Privacy | Fully Homomorphic Encryption | Enables computation over ciphertexts |
| Access Control | Role-based keys | Limits decryption to authorized HR groups |
| Integrity | Immutable recordkeeping | Guarantees data cannot be tampered |
| Transparency | Encrypted audit logs | Logs every computation without revealing content |
| Fairness | Aggregated metrics only | Prevents misuse or exposure of individual reviews |

Security is not an additional feature‚Äîit is the foundation of this system.
